            Christine小丁丁,
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I laughed and cried when I went over our pictures. 
            <br>
            Dump things we said and did that we were probably 
            <br>
            too busy to recall in college. I can’t think of any other 
            <br>
            friends that I was lucky enough to be around with for seven years. 
            <br>
            Even if we aren’t seeing each other everyday in our free period, 
            <br>
            or after school in cafe bene, I know that you are bringing happiness
            <br>
            to people around you, like you always do
            <br>
            (想想有多少男人喜欢你就知道了)
            <br>
            You always forget about your own life and devote so much time 
            <br>
            and care to others. In DE I thought you were the nicest person,
            <br>
            but now with everything happening, good or bad, you are 
            <br>
            also the strongest and coolest Christine ChowChow. 
            <br>
            Although I always want to ship you with someone, deep inside
            <br>
            I know there aren’t many guys that deserve you and  
            <br>
            you will find your own path.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ok I don’t want to make a graduation speech but 
            <br>
            How many times did we have kbbq at Berkeley?
            <br>
            <br>
            Can we book a trip instead??? 
            <br>
            <br>
            We can go to Alaska for the aurora or beaches or just NYC.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's do this in the Berkeley way.
            <br>
            Check your schedule, I’m available this Thanksgiving, 
            <br>
            winter break and maybe half a month in summer.
            <br>
            <br>
            I love you and happy 20th birthday!
            <br>
            It's so good to know you and thanks for everything. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Yours PP
